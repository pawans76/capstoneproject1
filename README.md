# Capstone-project-1
**DevOps capstone project-1:**

**Project Overview:**
The project outline is to create the CI/CD Pipeline by using DevOps tools. The task should be performed according to below requirements.
1. Install the necessary software on the machines using a configuration
management tool
2. Git workflow must be implemented
3. Code Build should automatically be triggered once a commit is made to
master branch or develop branch.
•	If a commit is made to master branch, test and push to prod
•	If a commit is made to develop branch, just test the product, do not
push to prod
4. The code should be containerized with the help of a Dockerfile. The
Dockerfile should be built every time there is a push to GitHub. Use the
following pre-built container for your application: hshar/webapp
The code should reside in '/var/www/html'
5. The above tasks should be defined in a Jenkins Pipeline with the following
jobs:
•	Job1: build
•	Job2: test
•	Job3: prod
